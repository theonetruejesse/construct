  "answeredQuestions": [
    {
      "question": "How should we handle the transition from tRPC's server actions to Convex mutations for cell updates?",
      "answer": "We should replace tRPC server actions with Convex mutations using the useConvexMutation hook from the official adapter. Instead of 'use server' actions, we'll create regular client-side handlers that call Convex mutations. These handlers will use TanStack Query's mutation options for optimistic updates, similar to the pattern: mutation.mutate(data, { onMutate, onError, onSettled })."
    },
    {
      "question": "Will the memoization patterns need adaptation to work efficiently with Convex's data model?",
      "answer": "The memoization patterns can largely remain unchanged as they focus on UI rendering optimizations rather than data fetching. The table state comparisons in the memoization functions will still work with Convex data. However, we may need to adjust equality checks that directly compare ID values to account for Convex's Id type, ensuring that string representation or proper ID comparison is used."
    },
    {
      "question": "How should we handle potential race conditions between optimistic updates and Convex's real-time updates?",
      "answer": "The TanStack Query adapter will handle most synchronization automatically. For optimistic updates, we'll use TanStack Query's 'onMutate' to apply local changes and 'onSettled' to ensure proper revalidation. We'll implement proper error handling in 'onError' to roll back optimistic updates if needed. Additionally, we'll maintain local state for cell edits that haven't been committed yet, similar to the VCell component's existing pattern of tracking lastValue vs current value."
    }
  ],
  "rationale": "After analyzing both the source VTable implementation and the Convex TanStack Query adapter, we've determined that the migration can maintain the same component architecture and memoization patterns while adapting the data layer. The official adapter provides the tools needed to replace tRPC queries and mutations while keeping the same optimistic update patterns and real-time capabilities. The memoization strategies in the components focus on UI rendering optimizations and will remain effective with Convex data structures with minor adjustments for ID comparisons."
