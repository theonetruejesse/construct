  "statement": "Convex's function organization can be adapted to implement a simplified version of the service-repository pattern using domain-focused modules and internal helper functions rather than strict layering.",
  "confidence": 0.75,
  "gapCharacterization": "The current construct API uses direct function-based access without domain organization or helper abstractions for code reuse.",
  "rationale": "While a strict service-repository pattern might add unnecessary complexity to Convex's architecture, we can still apply the pattern's core principles through domain-focused modules, internal helper functions, and clear separation of concerns without creating excessive layers or function call overhead.",

  "keyAssumptions": [
    "Convex's built-in query/mutation/action pattern already provides base separation of concerns",
    "Domain organization and helper functions can provide most benefits of service-repository without strict layering",
    "Convex's internal caching can replace Redis-based caching for performance optimization",
    "Functions can be organized to maximize code reuse while minimizing cross-function calls"

  "validationCriteria": [
    "Public API functions should be organized by domain",
    "Complex business logic should be extracted into internal helper functions",
    "Code organization should promote reuse and maintainability",
    "The approach must be compatible with Convex's transactional model",
    "Function calls should be minimized for performance"

  "critiquePoints": [
    "Domain boundaries might not always be clear in a complex application",
