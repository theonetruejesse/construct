  "gapCharacterization": "The current construct API schema only has a messages table and needs a complete VTable structure that leverages Convex's document model strengths while ensuring data integrity and efficient querying.",
  "rationale": "The migration plan confirms that a four-collection schema with strategic denormalization, composite indexes, and helper functions for integrity is effective for VTables in Convex. The plan details how to maintain relationships, optimize queries, and enforce integrity at the application level, validating this hypothesis.",
