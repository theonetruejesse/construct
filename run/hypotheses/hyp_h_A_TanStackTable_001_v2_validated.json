  "answeredQuestions": [
    {
      "question": "How should we handle the transition from tRPC's server actions to Convex mutations for cell updates?",
      "answer": "We should replace tRPC server actions with Convex mutations using the useConvexMutation hook from the official adapter. Instead of 'use server' actions, we'll create regular client-side handlers that call Convex mutations. These handlers will use TanStack Query's mutation options for optimistic updates, similar to the pattern: mutation.mutate(data, { onMutate, onError, onSettled })."
    },
    {
      "question": "Will the memoization patterns need adaptation to work efficiently with Convex's data model?",
      "answer": "The memoization patterns can largely remain unchanged as they focus on UI rendering optimizations rather than data fetching. The table state comparisons in the memoization functions will still work with Convex data. However, we need to adjust equality checks that directly compare ID values to account for Convex's Id type, ensuring that string representation or proper ID comparison is used."
    },
    {
      "question": "How should we handle potential race conditions between optimistic updates and Convex's real-time updates?",
      "answer": "The TanStack Query adapter will handle most synchronization automatically. For optimistic updates, we'll use TanStack Query's 'onMutate' to apply local changes and 'onSettled' to ensure proper revalidation. We'll implement proper error handling in 'onError' to roll back optimistic updates if needed. Additionally, we'll maintain local state for cell edits that haven't been committed yet, similar to the VCell component's existing pattern of tracking lastValue vs current value."
    },
    {
      "question": "How will the VTable component integrate with the shadcn/ui components?",
      "answer": "The VTable component will use the shadcn/ui components we've set up in our validated UI package (h_A_ShadcnSetup_001). Specifically, it will use the Table, TableHeader, TableBody, TableRow, TableCell components for the table structure, the Input component for editable cells, and Button, Select, and other components for various actions. We'll match the styling approach used in mcp-vtable, which includes custom CSS classes that extend the base shadcn/ui components."
    },
    {
      "question": "What specific shadcn/ui components are needed for the VTable implementation?",
      "answer": "Based on our analysis of the mcp-vtable implementation and the validated shadcn/ui setup, the VTable component will need: Table, TableHeader, TableBody, TableFooter, TableRow, TableCell components for the table structure; Input component for editable cells; Button component for actions; Select component for filtering and type selection; Popover and DropdownMenu components for column options; Skeleton component for loading states; and Dialog component for confirmations and form inputs."
    },
    {
      "question": "How should we structure the VTable package in relation to the UI package?",
      "answer": "The VTable package should be a separate package from the UI package, but it will depend on the UI package for shadcn/ui components. This maintains separation of concerns and allows the UI package to be used by other components without requiring the VTable implementation. The VTable package will import components from @construct/ui and will be structured similarly to the mcp-vtable implementation, with a main component, state management, and data handling components."
    }
  ],
  "rationale": "After analyzing both the source VTable implementation and the Convex integration options, we've determined that the migration can maintain the same component architecture and memoization patterns while adapting the data layer to use Convex. The shadcn/ui components from our validated UI package will provide the necessary UI elements for the table structure and interactions. The TanStack Query adapter for Convex will provide the tools needed for data fetching and mutations, maintaining the same optimistic update patterns and real-time capabilities. The memoization strategies in the components will remain effective with minor adjustments for Convex's ID type."
