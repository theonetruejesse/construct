  "answeredQuestions": [
    {
      "question": "Should we use the same component styles and configuration as the source project?",
      "answer": "Yes, we should use the exact same 'new-york' style variant and zinc base color configuration as the source project to maintain visual consistency. The customized component styles (especially for Table and Input) have specific modifications for the VTable use case that should be preserved."
    },
    {
      "question": "Are there any specific customizations needed for the construct project design system?",
      "answer": "Based on our analysis, we should maintain the exact customizations from mcp-vtable, including specific class names for table cells, borders, hover states, and input styling within cells. These customizations are integral to the VTable's appearance and functionality."
    },
    {
      "question": "Should we implement all shadcn/ui components or only the ones needed for VTable?",
      "answer": "We should implement only the components used by VTable, which include Table components, Input, Button, Select, Popover, Label, and Skeleton. These components have specific styling and behavior that's needed for VTable to function properly."
    }
  ],
  "rationale": "After analyzing the mcp-vtable project in detail, we've discovered that the shadcn/ui components have specific configurations and customizations that are tightly integrated with the VTable component. To ensure a successful migration, we need to preserve these exact customizations rather than using default shadcn/ui components. The export pattern in package.json is also critical to maintain import paths throughout the VTable implementation."
