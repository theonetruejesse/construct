  "answeredQuestions": [
    {
      "question": "Should we use the Custom Adapter Approach or the Real-time Subscription Integration?",
      "answer": "We should use the official Convex adapter for TanStack Query (@convex-dev/react-query) rather than creating custom hooks. This approach is officially supported, well-documented, and provides the same benefits of real-time updates and optimistic UI patterns while being simpler to implement and maintain."
    },
    {
      "question": "How will optimistic updates interact with Convex's real-time updates?",
      "answer": "Using the official adapter, optimistic updates will work through TanStack Query's standard mutation patterns. When a mutation is triggered, TanStack Query will optimistically update the UI, and when Convex sends a real-time update with the actual result, it will automatically sync through the adapter. This provides a seamless experience without requiring manual query invalidation."
    },
    {
      "question": "Will the performance be acceptable with both Convex and React Query running?",
      "answer": "Yes, the performance should be excellent since the official adapter is designed specifically to work efficiently with both systems. The adapter eliminates typical TanStack Query polling, leveraging Convex's real-time WebSocket-based updates instead, which is more efficient than standard REST API polling patterns."
    }
  ],
  "rationale": "The official Convex documentation provides a clear and well-supported approach for integrating with TanStack Query that is simpler and more maintainable than our previous custom integration proposal. This approach maintains all the benefits we were seeking (real-time updates, optimistic UI, etc.) while simplifying the implementation and ensuring better long-term compatibility and support."
