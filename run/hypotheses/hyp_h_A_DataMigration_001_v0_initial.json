  "statement": "The VTable data model can be migrated from Prisma to Convex by mapping relational entities to document collections with appropriate ID references and indexing.",
  "confidence": 0.6,
  "gapCharacterization": "The current construct API doesn't have a data model for VTables, and the architectural shift from Prisma's relational model to Convex's document model requires transformation.",
  "rationale": "Migrating from a relational model to a document model requires rethinking relationships, but the core entities (tables, columns, rows, cells) can be mapped across paradigms with adjustments for Convex's approach.",
  "refinementHistory": [],
  "keyAssumptions": [
    "Each Prisma model can map to a Convex collection with appropriate schema changes",
    "Relationship integrity can be maintained through ID references and application logic",
    "Convex IDs can replace the numeric primary keys from Prisma",
    "Type conversions between systems are straightforward for the data types used"
  ],
  "validationCriteria": [
    "All essential data from the Prisma schema must have an equivalent in the Convex schema",
    "The Convex schema must support all required VTable operations",
    "The migration strategy must account for all data integrity constraints",
    "The approach must follow Convex best practices for schema design"
  ],
  "critiquePoints": [
    "Document models might benefit from denormalization not present in the relational design",
    "Type handling might be different between the two systems",
    "Indexing strategy needs to be reconsidered for document model performance"
  ],
  "questions": [
    "Should we maintain strict normalization or leverage document embedding?",
    "What indexes are needed for optimal performance in Convex?",
    "How do we handle relationships that were enforced by the database in Prisma?"
  ],
  "alternativeApproaches": [
    "Create a hybrid model that takes advantage of document embedding for some relationships",
    "Completely redesign the data model to be more document-oriented rather than mapping the relational model",
    "Use a different collection structure that's optimized for common access patterns in Convex"
