  "statement": "Convex's document-based schema can represent VTables by using four primary collections: vtables, vtableColumns, vtableRows, and vtableCells, with appropriate relationships and indexes.",
  "confidence": 0.7,
  "gapCharacterization": "The current construct API schema only has a messages table and needs a complete VTable structure.",
  "rationale": "Convex supports rich document structures, but the relational approach from Prisma needs to be adapted to a NoSQL pattern while maintaining relationships between entities.",
  "refinementHistory": [],
  "keyAssumptions": [
    "Convex document IDs can replace numeric IDs for all VTable-related entities",
    "Cell values can be stored as strings and converted to appropriate types in the application",
    "Indexes will provide efficient access patterns similar to the relational model"
  ],
  "validationCriteria": [
    "The schema must define all four core collections (vtables, vtableColumns, vtableRows, vtableCells)",
    "Each collection must include all fields necessary for vtable operations",
    "Indexes must be defined for all common query patterns",
    "The schema must follow Convex best practices"
  ],
  "critiquePoints": [
    "Denormalized data might be more efficient in some Convex use cases",
    "Traditional foreign key relationships must be implemented through application logic",
    "Type conversion for cell values might add complexity"
  ],
  "questions": [
    "Should cell values be stored with type information or just as strings?",
    "What indexing patterns will be most efficient for vtable operations?",
    "Is there a more denormalized approach that could be more performant?"
  ],
  "alternativeApproaches": [
    "Use a more denormalized approach with rows containing embedded cell data",
    "Store all vtable data in a single collection with discriminated document types",
    "Use a hybrid approach with some embedding and some references"
