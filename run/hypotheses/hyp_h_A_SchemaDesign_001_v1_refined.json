  "gapCharacterization": "The current construct API schema only has a messages table and needs a complete VTable structure that leverages Convex's document model strengths.",
  "rationale": "While a direct mapping of the relational model to document collections is possible, a hybrid approach that leverages document embedding for certain relationships would better align with Convex's strengths and provide better performance for common access patterns.",

  "keyAssumptions": [
    "Convex document IDs can replace numeric IDs for all VTable-related entities",
    "Cell values can be stored as strings and converted to appropriate types in the application",
    "A hybrid approach with some denormalization can provide better performance than strict normalization",
    "Application-level integrity constraints can replace database foreign key constraints"

  "validationCriteria": [
    "The schema must define all core collections (vtables, vtableColumns, vtableRows, vtableCells)",
    "Each collection must include all fields necessary for vtable operations",
    "Indexes must be defined for all common query patterns",
