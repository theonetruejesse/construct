  "answeredQuestions": [
    {
      "question": "Should we use the Custom Adapter Approach or the Real-time Subscription Integration?",
      "answer": "We should use the Real-time Subscription Integration approach as it offers the best of both worlds: React Query's optimistic updates and cache management with Convex's real-time capabilities. This approach ensures that the UI remains responsive while also staying in sync with server changes."
    },
    {
      "question": "How will optimistic updates interact with Convex's real-time updates?",
      "answer": "When an optimistic update is applied, React Query will immediately update the UI. If the mutation succeeds, Convex will send a real-time update that confirms the change. If there's a conflict or error, the onError callback will roll back the optimistic update, and then the real-time update will sync the correct state. This ensures consistency while providing immediate feedback to users."
    },
    {
      "question": "Will the performance be acceptable with both Convex and React Query running?",
      "answer": "Yes, the performance should be acceptable as React Query primarily adds a caching layer on top of Convex's already efficient data fetching. The small overhead of maintaining the React Query cache is outweighed by the benefits of optimistic updates and improved user experience. If performance issues arise, we can fine-tune cache invalidation strategies."
