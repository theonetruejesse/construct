  "answeredQuestions": [
    {
      "question": "Should we use the same component styles and configuration as the source project?",
      "answer": "Yes, we should use the same component styles and configuration as the source project to maintain visual consistency and minimize the need for adaptation when migrating components. This means using the default shadcn/ui style and keeping the same component APIs and behavior."
    },
    {
      "question": "Are there any specific customizations needed for the construct project design system?",
      "answer": "Based on the existing construct project, we don't see any specific customizations needed at this stage. The project already uses TailwindCSS 4, which is compatible with shadcn/ui. We should maintain the default shadcn/ui styling to start with and make specific customizations only if required after the initial implementation."
    },
    {
      "question": "Should we implement all shadcn/ui components or only the ones needed for VTable?",
      "answer": "We should initially implement only the components needed for VTable to minimize the implementation time while ensuring all required functionality is available. However, we should structure the package to allow for easy addition of more components in the future. The essential components for VTable include Table-related components, Button, Input, Label, Select, Popover, and Skeleton."
