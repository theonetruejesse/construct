  "answeredQuestions": [
    {
      "question": "How will the type definitions change from tRPC to Convex?",
      "answer": "The type definitions will need to adapt to Convex's document-based data model. Specifically, we'll need to change ID types from numeric to Convex's Id<\"collection\"> type, update nullable handling to match Convex's approach, and ensure the transformation logic accommodates Convex's data structures. We'll also need to update types to work with the custom Convex-React Query integration."
    },
    {
      "question": "Will there be any performance implications in the migration?",
      "answer": "The migration to Convex might actually improve performance due to Convex's real-time capabilities and efficient data syncing. However, the addition of React Query could add some overhead. Overall, with proper implementation of the Real-time Subscription Integration approach, we should achieve good performance with the benefit of optimistic updates for better UX."
    },
    {
      "question": "Are there any features in the tRPC implementation that don't have direct equivalents in Convex?",
      "answer": "tRPC's type safety across the client-server boundary is more comprehensive than Convex's, though Convex does provide type generation. tRPC's prefetch functionality doesn't have a direct equivalent in Convex, but we can achieve similar results with React Query's prefetching capabilities. Additionally, some of tRPC's validation features will need to be implemented using Convex's validators or in the application code."
