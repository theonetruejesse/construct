  "statement": "The VTable API can be integrated into the construct project by creating a dedicated module in the Convex API that follows Convex best practices while maintaining the same functionality as the original tRPC API.",
  "confidence": 0.7,
  "gapCharacterization": "The current construct API doesn't have VTable functionality, and the API approach in Convex differs from tRPC used in mcp-vtable.",
  "rationale": "While the technology stack differs, the core VTable operations (creating tables/columns/rows, updating cells, fetching data) can be mapped to Convex queries and mutations with appropriate argument and return type validation.",
  "refinementHistory": [],
  "keyAssumptions": [
    "All VTable operations can be implemented using Convex queries and mutations",
    "The API surface can remain similar despite the underlying implementation differences",
    "Convex's built-in functionality can replace custom caching in most cases",
    "Validation can be implemented with Convex's validation system"
  ],
  "validationCriteria": [
    "All essential VTable operations must be available through the API",
    "The API must follow Convex best practices for function definition and organization",
    "Operations must maintain data integrity as in the original implementation",
    "The API should integrate cleanly with the existing construct codebase"
  ],
  "critiquePoints": [
    "Some tRPC features may not have direct equivalents in Convex",
    "Error handling approaches may differ between systems",
    "Performance characteristics will be different between tRPC and Convex"
  ],
  "questions": [
    "How should we organize the VTable functions in the Convex file structure?",
    "What validation approach should we use for complex inputs?",
    "How can we best leverage Convex-specific features for improved functionality?"
  ],
  "alternativeApproaches": [
    "Create a completely redesigned API that leverages Convex-specific features more heavily",
    "Implement a minimal subset of the API initially and expand gradually",
    "Build an abstraction layer that could work with either backend"
