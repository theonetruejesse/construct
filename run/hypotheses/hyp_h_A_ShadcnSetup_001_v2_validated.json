  "answeredQuestions": [
    {
      "question": "Should we use the same component styles and configuration as the source project?",
      "answer": "Yes, we should use the same component styles and configuration as the source project to maintain visual consistency. Our null challenge confirmed that mcp-vtable uses the 'new-york' style variant with custom CSS variables for theming, which we should replicate in the construct project."
    },
    {
      "question": "Are there any specific customizations needed for the construct project design system?",
      "answer": "Based on our null challenge findings, we need to maintain the CSS variables and theming approach used in mcp-vtable. The construct project's existing TailwindCSS setup is compatible with shadcn/ui, but we should ensure the tailwind.config.js includes the necessary plugins (tailwindcss-animate) and theme extensions to match mcp-vtable's customizations."
    },
    {
      "question": "Should we implement all shadcn/ui components or only the ones needed for VTable?",
      "answer": "We should implement the components needed for VTable plus a few additional ones that work closely with them. Our null challenge found that the Table component in mcp-vtable relies on Button, Input, Select, DropdownMenu, Dialog, and Popover components, so all of these should be included in the initial implementation for complete functionality."
    },
    {
      "question": "How are shadcn/ui components implemented in mcp-vtable?",
      "answer": "Our null challenge confirmed that mcp-vtable implements shadcn/ui components as direct source files rather than as a versioned package. Components are organized in a ui/ directory with each component having its own subdirectory. This approach allows for direct customization while maintaining the core functionality. We should follow this same approach in the construct project."
    },
    {
      "question": "What customizations have been made to shadcn/ui components in mcp-vtable?",
      "answer": "The Table component has been extended with sorting, filtering, and custom cell rendering capabilities to work with TanStack Table. Button, Input, and other components have custom variants defined through Tailwind classes. All components use CSS variables for theming defined in a global.css file. The cn utility function based on clsx and tailwind-merge is used for conditional class application."
    },
    {
      "question": "Are there any compatibility issues with the construct project's existing dependencies?",
      "answer": "Our null challenge verified that there are no compatibility issues with the construct project's existing dependencies. Since shadcn/ui components are implemented as direct source files rather than as a versioned package, we can ensure compatibility by directly controlling the implementation details."
