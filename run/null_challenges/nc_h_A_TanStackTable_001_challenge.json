      "description": "Verify the compatibility of TanStack Table v8.21.2 with Convex's data model and query patterns",
      "reasoning": "TanStack Table expects data in a specific format and we need to verify that Convex's document model can be efficiently transformed to this format. This is crucial because the entire table functionality depends on this compatibility.",
      "findings": "Analysis of the Convex data model shows that it can be efficiently transformed to match TanStack Table's expected format. The assembleVTableData query in the existing Convex implementation already structures the data in a way that's compatible with TanStack Table, with columns, rows, and cells formatted in the expected format. Using the @convex-dev/react-query adapter will allow us to fetch and use this data with TanStack Table's patterns without significant adaptation.",

      "description": "Assess the performance impact of memoization patterns when using Convex IDs instead of numeric IDs",
      "reasoning": "The memoization patterns in mcp-vtable rely on comparing table states and IDs. Convex uses a different ID format (Id<T> objects) which may impact the equality checks in the memoization functions.",
      "findings": "The memoization functions in VColumns and VRows primarily compare table state objects like columnSizing and columnOrder, which are generated by TanStack Table and are unaffected by the underlying ID type. For direct ID comparisons, we can use .toString() on Convex IDs or proper Id<T> comparison methods, maintaining the effectiveness of the memoization patterns. TanStack Table's internal handling doesn't require changing based on different ID types, as long as the IDs are stable between renders.",

      "reasoning": "The mcp-vtable implementation uses TanStack Query's mutation options for optimistic updates with tRPC. We need to verify that similar patterns can be used with Convex to maintain the same optimistic update experience.",
      "findings": "The existing useAddColumn hook in mcp-vtable uses optimistic updates with onMutate, onSuccess, and onError callbacks to handle optimistic updates. The @convex-dev/react-query adapter provides the same TanStack Query mutation API, allowing us to implement identical optimistic update patterns. The onMutate callback can be used to generate an optimistic preview of the data, while onSuccess and onError can handle server confirmation or rollback. The only difference is that we'll be using Convex's API instead of tRPC.",

      "findings": "Our analysis of shadcn/ui in mcp-vtable confirms that the components are implemented as direct source files with custom styling. The validated shadcn/ui setup (from h_A_ShadcnSetup_001) provides all necessary components with the same structure and styling approach. The Table components, Input for editable cells, and other required components are all available and follow the same pattern. The custom styling applied in mcp-vtable can be directly applied to our shadcn/ui components.",

      "reasoning": "Convex provides real-time updates which could potentially cause issues with TanStack Table's rendering cycle, especially when combined with optimistic updates. We need to verify that these patterns work together smoothly.",
      "findings": "The TanStack Query adapter for Convex handles the integration between real-time updates and the query cache. When a real-time update is received, it updates the cached data and triggers a re-render of components using that data. This works well with TanStack Table's rendering cycle, as it will re-render with the updated data. For optimistic updates, the adapter and TanStack Query together ensure that real-time updates don't overwrite optimistic states during a mutation, and properly reconcile the optimistic state with server updates once the mutation completes.",
