      "falsificationAnalysis": "The official Convex adapter for TanStack Query is in beta status, which could potentially introduce instability or breaking changes. However, being an official solution provides significant advantages: it's maintained by the Convex team, follows their best practices, and will likely receive ongoing support. The benefits of using the official adapter (simplified integration, maintained compatibility) outweigh the potential risks of its beta status. No significant evidence was found to suggest implementing a custom solution would be superior.",

For VTable's needs (querying data, adding rows, updating cells), the provided features appear sufficient. The adapter supports standard TanStack Query mutation patterns for optimistic updates, which should cover the VTable use cases. No evidence was found to suggest the integration would be inadequate for VTable's requirements.",
