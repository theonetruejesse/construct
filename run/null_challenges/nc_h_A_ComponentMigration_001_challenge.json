Given the complexity of the VTable component and its dependencies, a phased approach with clear dependencies handled first makes logical sense. While a more radical refactoring could potentially be more efficient in some cases, the proposed approach minimizes risk by maintaining the existing component structure which has already proven effective in the source project.",

The hypothesis acknowledges that tRPC's validation features and type safety might need additional implementation, but these are not insurmountable challenges. Convex's real-time capabilities actually provide an advantage over tRPC in terms of user experience. The proposed approach maintains awareness of these differences and addresses them appropriately.",

No evidence suggests this would introduce excessive complexity beyond what's reasonable for such a migration.",
