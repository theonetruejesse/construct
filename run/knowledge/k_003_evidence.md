**Summary:**
The Convex VTable API implementation in the construct project is well-structured and organized into separate files for tables, columns, rows, cells, and queries. The API provides comprehensive functionality for working with VTables, including creating, updating, and querying tables, columns, rows, and cells. The implementation uses Convex's document-based data model and provides validators for all data structures. The queries module includes an `assembleVTableData` function that efficiently fetches and structures all VTable data for a given table ID.

Key components of the Convex VTable implementation:

1. **Data Model**:

   - `vtables`: Stores table metadata
   - `vtableColumns`: Stores column definitions with types and options
   - `vtableRows`: Stores row data
   - `vtableCells`: Stores cell values

2. **Key Types**:

   - `AssembledVTable`: Complete VTable view including table, columns, and rows
   - `AssembledColumn`: Column with its metadata
   - `AssembledRow`: Row with its cells
   - `CellData`: Cell data with ID and value

3. **Main Queries**:

   - `getVTable`: Returns a fully assembled VTable for a given table ID
   - `listVTables`: Lists available VTables with optional owner filtering

4. **Efficient Data Assembly**:
   - The `assembleVTableData` function efficiently fetches all required data in parallel
   - Uses batch loading for cells to minimize database queries
   - Maps cell data by row for quick lookups

This implementation will need to be integrated with React Query in the frontend to support optimistic updates and efficient data fetching/caching.
